                                    <h3>History</h3>
                                        <p>This herbarium was founded in 1961 by the late Professor Tsang-Iang Chuang,
                                             who was then an assistant research fellow at the Institute of Botany.
                                             In the following year, Mr. Chuang left to take up advanced studies in the United States,
                                             and all related work ground to a halt. In 1983 Dr. Ching-I Peng resumed the herbarium's
                                             operations and registered the herbarium as "HAST"
                                             (Herbarium, Research Center for Biodiversity,
                                             Academia Sinica, Taipei) in the Index Herbariorum.
                                             Dr. Peng served as HAST curator until 1999 when he was replaced by Dr. Shu-Miaw Chaw.
                                             Dr. Peng resumed the post of curator in June 2003.</p>
                                        <p>Combining 'Herbarium, Institute of Botany' and 'Zoological Research Museum, Institute of Zoology',
                                             the Biodiversity Research Museum was established in the Biodiversity Research Center (BRC),
                                             Academia Sinica in 2007. The Museum’s collections dated as early as 1961.
                                             The main goal of the Museum is to preserve voucher specimens for scientific studies
                                             and to document biodiversity on earth. </p>

                                    <h3>Current status</h3>

                                        <p>HAST collects mainly vascular plants found in Taiwan (including its outlying islands)
                                             and the East Asian region. Special collections include Asteraceae, Begoniaceae, Commelinaceae,
                                             Lysimachia (Primulaceae), Asarum (Aristolochiacea), Amorphophallus (Araceae), Rubiaceae,
                                             Parthenocissus (Euphorbiaceae) and Theaceae. 
                                            For its fern collection, the herbarium possesses over 10,000 specimens collected by Mr. Bi-Jao Wang.
                                             When Dr. Yu-Ming Ju joined the Institute of Botany in early 2000,
                                             HAST also began a fungi specimen collection.</p>
                                        <p>As of Dec. 2013, over 136,000 determinated specimens have been numbered.
                                             Average accession rates are about 3,000 specimens per year.
                                             HAST exchanges duplicates with some 30 academic institutions around the world
                                             and focuses on acquiring plants from East Asia (especially mainland China and Japan).
                                             In addition to various domestic universities and botanical research institutions,
                                             current targets for such exchanges also encompass major universities, herbaria,
                                             museums and botanical gardens in Asian countries, the United States, Britain and Holland. </p>
                                        <p>Since 1995, with the assistance of Academia Sinica Computing Center,
                                             the results of HAST's research and the achievements in its collecting efforts
                                             have been posted on the World Wide Web, becoming the first database of its kind in Taiwan
                                             (containing over 111,800 specimens) to be open to searches by the public.</p>
                                        <p>The Research Museum has developed cutting-edge information management systems
                                             and online databases for the collections. 
                                            Information on the museum specimens can be accessed via the internet (http://museum.biodiv.tw).
                                             In addition, the museum staff has developed a number of biodiversity websites including:
                                             Database for Native Plants in Taiwan (http://taiwanflora.sinica.edu.tw);
                                             Discover Plants of Taiwan (http://taiwanplants.ndap.org.tw).
                                             For public education and services, the Research Museum periodically holds special
                                             exhibitions and provides museum tours for students, teachers and other civic organizations.</p>
