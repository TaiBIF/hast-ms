        <strong>The</strong> purpose of this project is mainly to produce a Taiwanese  botanical database, which consists of (1) label information and specimens  images of Taiwanese plant specimens housed at HAST (Herbarium, Academia Sinica,  Taipei); (2) taxonomic literature; (3) images of wild plants; and (4) WebGIS-based  plant distribution maps. Curatorial management of HAST herbarium is also  effectively executed through this system. Invaluable images of herbarium  specimens as well as plant photos taken in the wild are preserved permanently.  This database serves as a tool for understanding our indigenous flora and their  distribution. It also provides a useful reference to the utilization and  conservation of the plant resources of Taiwan.<br />
      This project has  completed the management system and the query system for the website “<em>Database of Native Plants</em> <em>in Taiwan</em>”. Thus far more than 40,000  records of specimens, 18,000 images of specimens, 1,900 records of literature  and about 4,000 images mainly of pteridophytes, Asteraceae, Begoniaceae,  Commelinaceae, Eriocaulaceae, Liliaceae, Onagraceae, Orchidaceae, Polygonaceae,  and Primulaceae are available on the web.</p>
